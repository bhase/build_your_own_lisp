# Build Your Own Lisp
This repository is a code collection to the book from Daniel Holden. See [http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/faq].

Changes to original book code:
* using readline instead of editline (only different name for library and header)
* no WIN32 support (I do not use it)
* created a Makefile
